# A Race Against Time

This marks the first project in a long series. 

We have decided to do 2 week projects where we pick a
random game idea (using a random game idea generator of
course), and then spending 2 weeks making it, then moving
on to the next project.

The first project idea given: 
A Side-scrolling Procedurally Generated Racing with the theme: Time Travel
